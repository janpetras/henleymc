			<h1>Winning solutions for people development.</h1>
			<p>HMC Consultancy services help transform businesses by defining and designing innovative and effective management and HR solutions. Working closely with clients, our consultants identify problems clearly and develop robust, integrated solutions for personal, team, HR or organisational development. With a broad range of experience covering the private, public and voluntary sectors, our consultants can deliver high quality tailored solutions.</p>

<p>Our commitment to clients is to develop maximum sustainable performance and to create a compelling place for employees to thrive and grow. The process begins with in-depth analysis, which highlights the key strategic and operational indicators helping or hindering our clientâ€™s success. Once problems have been defined and understood, we create capability enhancing solutions tailored to the specific business issue. The key success of our programme and project implementation is recognising that each business scenario is different and that people are central to methodologies and transformations that work.</p>
